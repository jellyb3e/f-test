# 121-Final-Project

## Devlog Entry - 14 November 2025

### Introducing the team

Aegis Michael: Design Lead
Julia Manou: Tools Lead + Testing Lead
Sophie DeGeorge: Engine Lead

### Tools and materials

Language: We decided to go with TypeScript since it’s what we’ve been using for the class and we are all familiar with the language. Because we’re using a web-dev environment, we’ll almost definitely be using CSS as well, and HTML is a given.
Tools: We will be coding in Visual Studio Code on codespaces because that is what we are most familiar with. Additionally, we will be using three.js for 3d rendering and ammo.js for physics.
Generative AI: We will not be using any generative AI.

### Outlook

We are hoping to expand on our knowledge of web development. More specifically, we are interested in learning how to make browser games more interesting and make more interesting browser games!
